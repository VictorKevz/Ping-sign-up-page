Ping Single Column Coming Soon Page

This project is a solution to the Ping Single Column Coming Soon Page challenge from Frontend Mentor.

Challenge Details
The challenge was to build a coming soon page and make it look as close to the provided design as possible. Key requirements included:

Ensuring the page's layout is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.
Implementing hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
Displaying an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty or the email address is not formatted correctly.
Solution Overview
This solution is built using React.js and CSS. It consists of the following components:

Hero Component (Hero.js): This component contains the main content of the page, including the logo, heading, subscription form, and dashboard image. It manages the user input for the email address and handles form submission and validation.

Footer Component (Footer.js): This component displays the footer section, including social media links and copyright information.

App Component (App.js): The main App component serves as the entry point for the application. It renders the Hero and Footer components within an outer container.

Features
Responsive design optimized for different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
Error handling for the email input field, displaying an error message if the input is empty or the email format is incorrect.
Hover effects for interactive elements such as buttons and social media icons.
